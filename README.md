# Library-Management-System

A library curates and stores potentially thousands of books. To concentrate on specific topics, in this project we will implement a library management system utilizing a simplified data set compared to all the information normally stored by a library's systems. In addition to simplifying the data, we have a specific set of instructions that our management system can perform.

Primary Project Topics
String Manipulation
File IO
Vectors
